Process (EUSVeh) “End use stock: Vehicles”
-----------------------------------------------

Short description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within this process, the new registration of vehicles for passenger transport is translated into material (M) 
in- and outflows using the respective material intensities (MI). Based on the evolution of the new registration, 
the demand for new vehicles is determined, which reflects material inflows. Material outflows are determined 
based on the material inflows and lifetime distributions. Consequently, this process can provide input 
for the demand side and waste generation after consolidation with the other end use sectors.

Exogenous parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter material intensity defines the share of material per passenger vehicles differentiated 
by vehicle type and size. The parameter new registrations defines the development of the new registrations 
differentiated by the same aspect.

Model variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable material inflow is determined from the demand for new cars and the material intensity. 
The variable material outflow is determined from the material inflow and the lifetime distribution.

Algebraic formulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

M_Inflow_Cars = MI_Cars*Cars_Inflow
M_Outflow_Cars = M_Inflow_Cars*LifetimeDist
