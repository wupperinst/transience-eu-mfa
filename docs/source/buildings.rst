Process (EUSBuild ) “End use stock: Buildings”
-----------------------------------------------

Short description
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within this process, the construction and demolition of buildings is translated into material (M) 
in- and outflows using the respective material intensities (MI). 
Consequently, this process can provide input for the demand side and the waste generation side 
after consolidation with the other end use sectors.

Exogenous parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The parameter material intensity defines the share of material per square metre differentiated 
by building type and age cohort. The parameters building inflow and outflow define the construction 
and demolition of buildings differentiated by the same aspects.

Model variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variables material in- and outflows are determined from the construction and demolition of 
buildings as well as the material intensity.

Algebraic formulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

M_Inflow_Buildings = MI_Building*Building_Inflow
M_Outflow_Buildings = MI_Building*Building_Outflow
