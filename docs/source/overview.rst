Context
------------------------------

The EU MFA module of the MIC3 model framework (Model for European Industry Circularity and Climate Change Mitigation) 
is a multi-regional dynamic Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of the basic materials steel, plastics and cements. 
In the baseline workflow of MIC3 shown below, it receives inputs from the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) module, 
the energy system module and, the global MFA module. The EU MFA provides output for the techno-economic industry modules. 
Within the MIC3 framework, the EU MFA plays a key role for assessing circular economy measures. 
These relationships are described in detail in other documents. 
The present documentation focuses on the design of the EU MFA module.
