# EU MFA module
*This repo displays the status of development for the EU MFA module within the TRANSIENCE project (Task 4.3).*

The EU MFA module is a multi-regional dynamic Material Flow Analysis (MFA) of the basic materials steel, plastics and cement. 
It is able to combine bottom-up approaches for buildings and vehicles with top-down approaches for steel, plastics and cement.
